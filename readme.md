# Homework checker #

This is a python module and script that can be used to check homeworks. One can
specify the expected results in the form of a `yaml` file specifying excercises
and specific tests for them. The result is a markdown file with a table of
results and a list of encountered errors.

To set up a new job script, follow the [`schema.yml`](schema/schema.yml) file.
this file is automatically generated and your script should follow the guides
defined in the schema file. For an example job script, see
[`example_job.yml`](tests/example_job.yml)

## Prerequesits ##
We need `ruamel.yaml` and `schema` libraries to run this code. Install them
with:
```
sudo pip3 install ruamel.yaml schema
```

## Start digging ##
If you want to change anything, start from `check_homework` script and dig from
there.
